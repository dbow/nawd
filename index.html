    var QUOTES = [
      "The most radical revolutionary will become a conservative the day after the revolution.",
      "The sad truth is that most evil is done by people who never make up their minds to be good or evil.",
      "Only crime and the criminal, it is true, confront us with the perplexity of radical evil; but only the hypocrite is really rotten to the core.",
      "Watching television is like taking black spray paint to your third eye.",
      "You are a victim of the rules you live by.",
      "At times inactivity is preferable to mindless functioning.",
      "No one is easier to manipulate than a man who exaggerates his own influence.",
      "Justice must always question itself, just as society can exist only by means of the work it does on itself and on its institutions.",
      "The lyricism of marginality may find inspiration in the image of the “outlaw,” the great social nomad, who prowls on the confines of a docile, frightened order.",
      "In the depth of winter, I finally learned that within me there lay an invincible summer.",
      "Do not wait for the last judgment, it takes place every day.",
      "Man is the only creature that refuses to be what he is.",
      "Man stands face to face with the irrational. He feels within him his longing for happiness and for reason. The absurd is born of this confrontation between the human need and the unreasonable silence of the world.",
      "In individuals, insanity is rare; but in groups, parties, nations and epochs, it is the rule.",
      "Politics hates a vacuum. If it isn't filled with hope, someone will fill it with fear.",
      "A concept is a brick. It can be used to build a courthouse of reason. Or it can be thrown through the window.",
      "It is not the slumber of reason that engenders monsters, but vigilant and insomniac rationality.",
      "Courage consists, however, in agreeing to flee rather than live tranquilly and hypocritically in false refuges. Values, morals, homelands, religions, and these private certitudes that our vanity and our complacency bestow generously on us, have many deceptive sojourns as the world arranges for those who think they are standing straight and at ease among stable things.",
      "To become imperceptible oneself, to have dismantled love in order to become capable of loving. To have dismantled one's self in order finally to be alone and meet the true double at the other end of the line. A clandestine passenger on a motionless voyage. To become like everybody else; but this, precisely, is a becoming only for one who knows how to be nobody, to no longer be anybody. To paint oneself gray on gray.",
      "It is always from the depths of its impotence that each power center draws its power, hence their extreme maliciousness, and vanity.",
      "The technocrat is the natural friend of the dictator—computers and dictatorship; but the revolutionary lives in the gap which separates technical progress from social totality, and inscribed there his dream of permanent revolution. This dream, therefore, is itself action, reality, and an effective menace to all established order; it renders possible what it dreams about.",
      "Nationalism can only ever be a crucial political agenda against oppression. All longing to the contrary, it cannot provide the absolute guarantee of identity.",
      "The truly powerful feed ideology to the masses like fast food while they dine on the most rarified delicacy of all: impunity.",
      "It is difficult to get a man to understand something, when his salary depends upon his not understanding it!",
      "This is an emergency, a present emergency, not a future one, but we aren’t acting like it.",
      "To continue being human will my sacrifice be forgetting?",
      "The desire for security and the feeling of insecurity are the same thing. To hold your breath is to lose your breath. A society based on the quest for security is nothing but a breath-retention contest in which everyone is as taut as a drum and as purple as a beet.",
      "Bring something incomprehensible into the world!",
      "Forgiveness is an attribute of living matter.",
      "Only one thing is more frightening than speaking your truth. And that is not speaking.",
      "Perfection is a stick with which to beat the possible.",
      "Hope locates itself in the premises that we don’t know what will happen and that in the spaciousness of uncertainty is room to act.",
      "No one has imagined us. We want to live like trees, sycamores blazing through the sulfuric air, dappled with scars, still exuberantly budding, our animal passion rooted in the city.",
